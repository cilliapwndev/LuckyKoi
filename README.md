# LuckyKoi: Sovereign Architect 🎏
### *Master your cash flow. Build your fortress. Become the Dragon.*

**LuckyKoi** is a high-performance, native desktop financial architect built for the modern sovereign individual. Unlike "budgeting" apps that focus on restriction, LuckyKoi focuses on **Leverage**. By calculating the ratio between your monthly cost of living (Baseline) and your current liquid capital (Vault), it visualizes exactly how much "Life Freedom" you have secured.

## 🧠 The Calculation Engine

LuckyKoi doesn't just add and subtract; it audits your financial efficiency using three core mathematical pillars:

### 1. The Sovereignty Ratio ($R$)
The app's primary metric is the Ratio ($R$), which represents how many months of your current lifestyle you can sustain without further income.
$$R = \frac{\text{Current Balance}}{\text{Monthly Income Baseline}}$$
* **0.0 - 1.0x:** You are in the *Survival Zone*.
* **1.0 - 6.0x:** You are in the *Security Zone*.
* **12.0x+:** You have achieved one full year of **Sovereignty**.

### 2. Real-Time Efficiency ($E$)
The Live Analytics bar uses a flow calculation to show your retention rate. It compares your total Lifetime Income ($I$) against your Lifetime Expenses ($X$).
$$E = \left( \frac{I - X}{I} \right) \times 100$$
This is visualized in the **Analytics** tab as a real-time progress bar, giving you instant psychological feedback on every purchase.

### 3. The Impulse Audit
The "Impulse-Free" counter scans your transaction history for any single expense that exceeds **5% of your Monthly Baseline**. 
* If a transaction $T > (Baseline \times 0.05)$, the counter resets. 
* This enforces the **48-Hour Rule**, training your brain to decouple dopamine from spending.
